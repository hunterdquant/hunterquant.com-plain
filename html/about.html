      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm currently a student and loving every second of it. I've had a love for education my entire life and I'm happy that I've retained that love.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have many interests including, but not limited to: Computer Graphics, Computer Vision, Computer Networks, and Artificial Intelligence.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of my favorite hobbies is playing and making video games. Video games are more than a means to kill time. They are a form of expression, art, and cognitive development.
